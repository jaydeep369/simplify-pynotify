We can monitor linux directories using "pyinotify".
This documentation will demonstrate how to use a Python script to monitor a directory, you can take reference from it and use as per your convinience.
Clone this repo at "/usr/local/src/" to follow the same steps, path may be vary as differnt clone location and path for python also different for different os.
We need to Install Python 3 and pyinotify to use above script.
Use below commands to install dependencies
For Debian:
apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y
pip3 install pyinotify

For Centos:
yum install epel-release -y
yum install python3 python3-pip -y
pip3 install pyinotify

- I am writing the changes in file "/usr/local/src/output.txt" and monitoring the directory "/usr/local/src/monitor/", any of file will be created and there, it will noted down in output.txt file.
- service file dirwatch.service you can also manage as per your convinience, to use this service file you can copy it to "/etc/systemd/system/" and start stop dirwatch service.
If you're changing path of dirwatch.py or if python3 full path is different, you can manage it accordingly.
